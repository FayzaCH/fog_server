'''
    Host and path selection algorithms for network applications based on their
    requirements. It uses the Strategy design pattern to make it easier to
    define various algorithms that can be chosen at runtime.

    Classes:
    --------
    NodeSelector: Node selector through given algorithm.

    PathSelector: Path selector through given algorithm.

    Algorithms:
    -----------
    SIMPLE: Simple selection of nodes that satisfy required CPU, RAM, and disk.

    DIJKSTRA: Best path selection based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
    Calculates link weights and gets the shortest path from the source node to
    each potential destination node.

    LEASTCOST: Best path selection based on path cost that is calculated with
    an equation that includes bandwidth cost, delay cost, jitter cost, and
    loss rate cost.
